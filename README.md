# Directory
Place your iwbtg executable of choice into this git repo.
iwbtg places saves in a directory called `save` in the same directory as the executable.

# Note
The [iwbtg download page](http://kayin.moe/iwbtg/downloads.php) has IWBTF (I wanna be the fix),
which will be much more flexible than anything committed here.
